# Pokedex App

This is a simple **Pokedex application built using React**. It utilizes the PokeAPI to fetch and display information about Pokémon, providing features like displaying Pokémon, loading more Pokémon, searching, and more. Additionally, the app offers both dark and light modes for user preference.

For this project, I've used JavaScript to handle most of the coding stuff. CSS modules made styling in React easier, keeping things organized. And with React, I've played around with state management and hooks like useEffect and custom hooks to make things more interactive and smooth.
